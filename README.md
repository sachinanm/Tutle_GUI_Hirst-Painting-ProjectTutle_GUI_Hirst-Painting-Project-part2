# The Hirst Painting Project 🎨

![Hirst Painting](https://i.imgur.com/abcdefgh.png)

This project recreates Damien Hirst's famous Spot Painting using Python's Turtle module. With just 25 randomly colored dots, we can create a colorful masterpiece that sold for more than half a million pounds!

## What Are We Up To? 🤔

In this project, we aim to recreate Damien Hirst's artwork using Python's Turtle module. We'll create a grid of 10x10 dots, each with a size of 20 and spaced apart by 50 units. The colors for the dots will be extracted from a spot painting image using the Colorgram package.

## Prerequisites 🖍️

- Familiarity with the Turtle module (If not, the internet is your savior. It's easy to learn 😉).
- Installation of the Colorgram package to add vibrant colors to our painting.
- Basic comprehension of the RGB color system 🧮.

## Let's Paint! 🎨

### Task - 1 🖌️

1. Start by downloading a spot painting image.
2. Extract the colors from the image using the Colorgram package.
3. Create a list of color tuples (r, g, b) and copy them into your main.py file.
4. Comment out the code for color extraction (we only need to do it once).

### Beware of the Whites! ⚪

Inspect your color tuples to remove any whites or unwanted colors from the background.

### Task - 2 🖌️

1. Draw a 10x10 grid of dots with a size of 20 and spacing of 50 units.
2. Use the dot() function to draw the colorful dots with random RGB colors.
3. Move the turtle to the intended starting position for the grid.
4. Create a for loop to draw dots row by row.
5. We then add more codes to the for loop to make the turtle move to the next row and start from the front & keep moving further drawing dots.
6. Adjust the turtle speed, hide the turtle cursor, and use penup() to make the forward lines vanish (without affecting the dots).

Hooray, our painting is ready! 🎉

## Things We Learned 🕮️

-The Turtle module is a powerful tool for crafting captivating graphics in Python! 🐢
-Contemporary art can sometimes carry astonishing price tags! 😝
